This independently maintained **Enhanced** fork tracks the upstream release base and adds an
opt-in Web-session lifecycle for long-running Codex and Claude Code work. Fork releases use the
`<upstream>-Enhanced.<revision>` version format, beginning with `3.0.1-Enhanced.1`.

Free and Go accounts get **ChatGPT Web — Luna** in Codex's native model picker. Accounts that
expose the reasoning selector keep **Instant**, **Medium**, **High**, **Extra High**, and **Pro** as
their subscription allows. The bridge sends the current compiled Codex task context to a fresh
ChatGPT conversation (Temporary Chat by default), attaches images, and streams visible reasoning, tool activity, and Markdown
back into the same Codex task.

Codex / Claude Code ──Responses or Messages──▶ local bridge ──browser──▶ ChatGPT
        ▲                                          │                        │
        └──────── context, tools, streaming, compact, and lifecycle ────────┘
```

Codex keeps the native task, context lifecycle, UI, and tool harness. The local Responses bridge
routes only the selected model turn through a task-bound ChatGPT conversation (Temporary Chat by default); in full mode, MCP
connects ChatGPT back to the tools of that same Codex task.

1. **Install the launcher** using the download for your system above.
2. **Sign in to ChatGPT** in the embedded browser and run the browser smoke test.
3. **Install models** and restart Codex once. In automatic mode, choose a model ending in **(Web)**. Pro versions have separate entries; Sol reasoning is selected through Effort. Zero Risk keeps its dedicated entry.
4. **For coding with tools**, open **MCP** in the launcher and complete the Full harness setup below.

## Highlights

- **A polished cross-platform launcher.** One command installs the native macOS, Windows, or Linux
  app. It keeps sign-in orchestration, setup, smoke testing, MCP guidance, runtime health, and local
  logs in one place, while the embedded browser lets you watch every ChatGPT turn as it happens. Up
  to six task-bound browser tabs can run in parallel in Enhanced mode; the cap avoids excessive parallel account
  traffic.
- **ChatGPT is the selected model.** It runs as a native Codex model, not as a tool called by
  another host model. The original model picker, task lifecycle, streaming, tracing, and tool UI
  remain intact.
- **Local-first task sessions.** Codex or Claude Code remains the source of truth for task history
  on your computer. Original mode follows the configured upstream conversation policy. Enhanced mode retains a
  completed root or subagent conversation for 30 minutes and sends only the continuation suffix.
  Codex Desktop binds that conversation to its stable native session key, so rebuilt base instructions
  do not discard a live retained tab; current developer and environment updates travel in the suffix.
  Other clients rotate on an exact system-instruction change. Compaction likewise starts a new epoch. Browser chats are never
  shared across unrelated tasks. Temporary Chat is the default; Saved Chats explicitly opts
  Codex and Claude task conversations into ChatGPT history, never API Access.
- **Codex and Claude Code clients.** The launcher installs either integration independently.
  Codex uses the OpenAI-compatible Responses route; Claude Code uses the standard Anthropic
  Messages stream while preserving Markdown, tool-use blocks, subagents, additive steering, and
  native `/compact` and recap behavior.
- **The full Codex harness over MCP.** In Full mode, every effort available to the signed-in account—
  Luna, Instant, Medium, High, Extra High, and Pro—can use the active Codex task's filesystem,
  shell, images, approvals, and configured tools/apps through the same turn-bound MCP capability.
  Calls and real results stay inside the same browser response; nothing is simulated as text.
- **No Pro exception.** Pro follows exactly the same MCP, context, image, tracing, tool-round,
  browser-ceiling, and compaction contracts as every other effort. There are no effort-specific MCP
  exclusions. Browser-only mode remains read-only for every route.
- **Fail-closed with an explicit release gate.** UI drift and missing capabilities produce explicit
  errors rather than silent fallbacks. Account-bound model selection, long context, images,
  streaming, compaction, native tool rounds, cancellation, and Pro are covered by a separate
  account-bound release validation process, independently of package smoke.

Temporary Chat is a ChatGPT privacy mode, not anonymity or local-only inference: prompts are still
processed by OpenAI and are subject to the account's settings and OpenAI's
[Temporary Chat policy](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq). This project
is unofficial; users remain responsible for complying with applicable OpenAI terms and workspace
policies.

## Quick start

Install or update the desktop launcher. To update or repair an existing installation, quit the
launcher and run the same command again; it replaces the application and embedded runtime while
preserving the ChatGPT profile and launcher configuration.

**macOS or Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Evanlau1798/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.sh | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/Evanlau1798/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.ps1 | iex
```

Then complete the three checks in the app:

1. Sign in in the embedded app by default. If your account requires a passkey, choose **Use Chrome
   for passkey**; after Chrome verifies Temporary Chat, the launcher imports verified,
   non-partitioned ChatGPT/OpenAI session cookies and, for passkey transfer, `chatgpt.com` local
   storage into its private Electron profile, then verifies the composer again.
   If configured Chrome is unavailable, the launcher uses embedded sign-in directly.
2. Run the browser smoke test.
3. Use **Install into Codex** and/or **Install into Claude Code**. Completing either integration
   finishes setup; they can be installed or refreshed independently. Restart the selected client.

The launcher detects the current account's ChatGPT controls during setup: Free/Go accounts expose
only Luna, while Pro appears only when the signed-in account exposes it. The separate **MCP** page
is optional and guides the full-harness setup without terminal commands.

The packaged launcher keeps sign-in and ChatGPT model turns in its embedded browser. It needs no
model API key, installed Chrome/Chromium, system Node/Bun, or project-managed browser download.

**Run from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evanlau1798/codex-chatgpt-web.git && \
cd codex-chatgpt-web && \
bun run app
```

Zero Risk does not read or operate the ChatGPT page. Choose the model and `Codex Zero Risk` connector yourself, paste and send the prepared prompt, then confirm **Sent** in the launcher. Automatic models ending in **(Web)** expose their supported Effort choices in Codex. Instant and each Pro version have separate entries to preserve their context budgets; older saved model entries keep their original fixed mode.

This source path requires Bun 1.4.0+34cbb9a40. The command installs locked dependencies and opens the app.

## Modes

| Mode | Models | Local Codex tools | Extra setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser-only** | Free/Go: Luna; Plus: Instant–High; Pro: adds Extra High and Pro | No; Codex shows a warning | None |
| **Full harness (With Automation)** | Free/Go: Luna; Plus: Instant–High; Pro: adds Extra High and Pro | Yes for every listed effort, including Pro | OpenAI tunnel + ChatGPT connector |
| **Zero Risk** | Choose the ChatGPT model and effort manually; optional Pro-sized context | Yes; the full turn-bound Codex harness remains available | Separate OpenAI tunnel + `Codex Zero Risk` connector; paste and send manually |

New automatic **(Web)** entries expose only supported Effort choices; Instant and each Pro family
keep separate context budgets. Legacy entries retain their fixed bindings. The requested family
and effort must be verified before Send; unsupported selections fail without a silent fallback. In automatic Full
mode every available effort receives the same turn-bound MCP capability. Pro has no separate
restriction or reduced tool contract.

Zero Risk keeps the local Responses bridge and full Codex harness, but never reads or changes the
ChatGPT page and never sends a prompt for you. The launcher prepares and copies the prompt; you
choose the model, effort, and `Codex Zero Risk` connector, then paste and send it yourself. This
removes the account risk specifically associated with ChatGPT web automation.

### Fast startup (experimental)

`6.1.4-Enhanced.1` adds **Fast startup**, an opt-in switch in **Settings**. It prepares an
unsent standby Web page with the last verified model and a harness draft, then inserts the
current request after checking the account, model, and draft again. Preparation does not send
a message. Real tasks take priority; a standby page is prepared only when the page limit has room.
Account Safety's **Maximum concurrency** applies, with six sessions as the default when that
limit is disabled. Completed pages retained by TTL are not standby pages.

Native2 progress can stream while work is running; the complete final answer is committed
once through the output tunnel. Startup and final-settlement diagnostics help distinguish
local preparation time from time spent waiting for ChatGPT.

**Known limitation:** a sporadic continuation can fail model verification before
Send. Additional diagnostics are included; the root cause remains under investigation.

### Enhanced Web session mode

This setting is enabled by default for new Enhanced fork installations and affects only
`chatgpt-web/*` routes. Existing explicit choices are preserved, while older configurations that
never selected a mode migrate conservatively with it disabled. Native OpenAI/Codex models always
keep their original Responses and compact paths, regardless of this setting.

When disabled, Web models follow the upstream session and compact behavior. When enabled, the
bridge adds 30-minute retained root/subagent conversations, same-conversation steering, six-way
browser scheduling, structured handoff compaction, canonical continuation after stop/restart, and
bootstrap/archive transport for prompts that exceed the measured inline browser boundary. Stable
system instructions are not replayed on each continuation. Codex Desktop uses its stable native session
key while current turn-local context remains in the suffix; clients without that identity rotate on an
exact system-instruction change. A compact also starts a new conversation epoch; old turn tokens
and completed tool calls are not replayed.

Enhanced Automatic tool turns enable **Tunnel Web agent output** by default. User-visible progress,
reasoning summaries, and the final answer return through the existing Native2 tunnel, while ChatGPT
still displays its normal tool cards. The bridge watches only turn status on the successful path; if
the tunnel omits a final answer, it validates the already-finished response in the same page without
resubmitting the prompt. Disabling Enhanced or selecting Zero Risk preserves the setting but disables
this transport.

### Bigger Context (experimental)

This separately controlled feature can carry a request larger than one measured ChatGPT
message while keeping every individual composer submission inside its verified boundary. The bridge
uses one, two, or six total messages in the same task chat, verifies an exact acknowledgement
for each part, and executes the task only from the final commit message. Connector selection is
bounded to three complete `@codex` attempts, and a missing connector fails explicitly instead of
opening replacement sessions indefinitely.

Bigger Context does not replace compaction and does not change native OpenAI/Codex routing. Disable
it if you prefer the normal single-message transport; Enhanced session retention, steering, and
handoff compact remain independent.

### Context controls: what each switch actually changes

**Enhanced Web session mode** keeps one task-bound ChatGPT conversation across tool rounds,
steering, and compaction. It changes conversation continuity only: it neither enlarges the context
window nor disables compaction. **Bigger Context** is mutually exclusive with Enhanced mode. It
uses one, two, or six total browser messages. A six-message transaction contains five inert
stages followed by one final execution message;
each message is a real ChatGPT request that can consume account allowance. It triples the context
and compaction thresholds advertised to Codex, while ChatGPT's own message, model, composer,
transport, and service limits remain in force.

**No Context Window** removes only those routed context-window and automatic-compaction thresholds
from the model catalog that Codex reads. It does not create unlimited context, bypass ChatGPT
limits, stop token accounting, or turn an oversized browser prompt into a valid request. Such a
prompt still fails closed. Use it only when another workflow deliberately owns compaction or the
task can tolerate unbounded canonical history.
With Enhanced Web Session, the bridge keeps a private recovery checkpoint at safe completed-tool
boundaries (about 100K tokens on Pro; earlier on Plus to fit a fresh page). The retained page keeps
running. If it fails, a fresh page receives the latest durable checkpoint plus the canonical work
that followed it. Pending tool effects are never replayed just to recover a page.

## Claude Code

Choose **Install into Claude Code** in the launcher to configure the local `/v1/messages` gateway,
the selected Web model alias, and the managed steering hooks. No model API key is required; the
installed gateway key is the local placeholder `local`. Claude Code root turns and subagents keep
separate Web conversations, and mid-turn prompts are appended at a normal tool-result boundary
instead of interrupting or replacing an in-flight tool result.

The bridge emits ordinary Web commentary as Claude `text` blocks, real reasoning as `thinking`,
and tool calls as standard `tool_use` blocks. Markdown and code fences are passed through verbatim.
Claude's native `/compact`, recap, resume, and subagent lifecycle remain client-owned; Enhanced mode
only controls the corresponding Web surface retention and safe continuation.

## Full harness

Full mode connects ChatGPT's tool calls back to the current Codex task through the official
[OpenAI tunnel-client](https://github.com/openai/tunnel-client). The tunnel is outbound: it does
not expose a public IP, open an inbound port, or require router forwarding.

The launcher's **MCP** page guides the complete setup. For the exact clicks, see the
[video walkthroughs](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

> **Limits**
>
> See [Limits](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/discussions/309) for the current
> ChatGPT message allowances for **GPT-5.6 Sol Pro** and **GPT-6 Astra**. Context limits depend on
> the account type and selected effort. Plus Medium/High uses a measured 90,000-token window, or
> up to 270,000 tokens with experimental **3× context** enabled, with native Codex compaction
> supported throughout.

1. Finish the required setup, open **MCP**, create the Tunnel and regular API key, then press
   **Connect harness**.
2. Enable ChatGPT **Developer Mode** and create a new Tunnel connector with the exact name shown
   in the launcher (**Codex Native2** by default), with **Authentication: None** and **Allow all actions**.
3. Run **Verify runtime** to confirm that the displayed connector is attached and available.

Write/modify actions also require the ChatGPT workspace and its administrator policy to permit
them. See
[developer mode and MCP apps](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-mcp-apps-in-chatgpt).
Unexpected approval prompts fail closed unless `--auto-approve-tool-calls` is explicitly enabled;
that option clicks **Allow once**, never a permanent grant.

## Operations

Use **Activity** for safe local diagnostics and **Settings → Run doctor** for end-to-end health.
Settings can also cancel a retained browser turn or remove the Codex integration before uninstall.
**Save chats in ChatGPT** is off by default and applies to Codex and Claude task conversations.
API Access remains Temporary Chat in both direct and native-tool paths and rejects `store:true`.
Turning Saved Chats off does not delete existing history.

**New browser chat for each turn** is opt-in and available only in Original Automatic mode.
Enhanced and Zero Risk force it off at the UI, launcher, configuration and adapter boundaries,
including stale configuration. This is independent of whether chats are saved.

**Limits** is opt-in local usage accounting, not an official remaining-quota display or a
replacement for Account Safety. Physical accepted sends are counted once; accounting failures
cannot replay a submission. Zero Risk performs no automatic plan inspection or tracking.
API `reasoning_effort` accepts supported choices on new routes, keeps legacy routes fixed, and
binds effective family/effort across all tool-result HTTP rounds of one native Web generation.
Set `CODEX_CHATGPT_WEB_BROWSER_DIAGNOSTICS=1` only when every browser checkpoint needs a screenshot.

Browser turn diagnostics save bounded JSON state at each checkpoint. Screenshots are captured for
stalled and failed turns, where the visible UI is needed to diagnose DOM drift without slowing every
successful step. Set `CODEX_CHATGPT_WEB_BROWSER_DIAGNOSTICS=1` before starting the runtime to also
capture a screenshot at every checkpoint during an investigation.

Subagent protocol is an explicit installation setting and is independent of Enhanced Web session
mode. New installs default to **Compatibility V1** for the broadest cross-backend compatibility: it
enables `multi_agent`, disables the global `multi_agent_v2` override, and restores the user's
previous feature lines on disconnect or uninstall. It also raises `[agents].max_depth` to at least
2 while active so Web children can spawn Web grandchildren, then restores the prior value. Native
and Web parents can therefore delegate to Web children without opaque V2 payloads, and targeted
waits can observe a child that completed before the parent began waiting. Web parents expose
`wait_agent` as explicit 10-second polls so one long wait cannot occupy the connector's MCP channel
and block the child's own tools.

**Native V2** is a fully supported opt-in for current Codex collaboration semantics. It preserves
Codex's own feature settings and supports plaintext hierarchical Web delegation, targeted messages,
waits, and interruption across root, child, and grandchild agents. Switch protocols deliberately,
then restart Codex and start a new task because an existing task cannot change protocol in place:

```bash
codex-chatgpt-web subagents status
codex-chatgpt-web subagents compatibility-v1
codex-chatgpt-web subagents native
```

## Limitations and security

- This is unofficial browser automation, not an OpenAI API. ChatGPT UI changes can break selectors;
  drift fails explicitly instead of silently switching model or transport.
- Browser state is a sensitive login artifact, and the loopback listener is reachable by processes
  running as the same local user. Never share the launcher profile; use a trusted workstation.
- Release packages currently target macOS 13+ (arm64/x64), Windows x64, and Linux x64/arm64. Runtime,
  tests, and native packaging are gated on all three operating systems in CI. Account-bound browser
  and MCP flows require separate release validation; package smoke is not treated as end-to-end
  proof.
- Until platform signing credentials are configured for a release, macOS Gatekeeper or Windows
  SmartScreen may show an unknown-publisher warning. The one-command installers verify the
  published SHA-256 manifest before installation.

Read the complete [architecture](docs/architecture.md) and
[security model](docs/security-model.md) before enabling full mode. Report vulnerabilities through
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development

```bash
bun run app
bun run dev:launcher
bun run src/cli.ts dev status
bun run dev:chat compaction-lab "Reply with exactly: DEV READY"
bun run verify
bun run smoke:subagents
bun run app:package
```

`dev:launcher` starts a second launcher profile under `~/.codex-chatgpt-web-dev`: separate Electron
state, browser cookies/login, ChatGPT account, configuration, sandboxed `CODEX_HOME`, chats,
diagnostics, broker, and tunnel profile. It can run beside the normal launcher and never starts a
Responses daemon or changes Codex. Optional Full setup starts and supervises only its isolated MCP
tunnel, using the distinct ChatGPT connector name `Codex Native2 DEV`.

`dev:chat` is a named, persistent synthetic outer-Codex harness. It executes the current working
tree through that isolated launcher browser, Temporary Chat, prompt compiler, Responses parser, and
compaction handlers. Optional Full setup also exercises the MCP connector and broker; tool effects
are explicit simulation receipts. Browser-only chats expose no outer tools. It does
not open a Responses listener, change `openai_base_url`, stop the live daemon, or claim port 17841.
Run it without a message for `/status`, `/fill 30000`, `/compact`, `/model`, and `/reset` commands.
Sign in and initialize the profile once inside the window labelled **DEV**. Configure optional Full
harness only for simulated tool rounds; its launcher keeps the DEV tunnel ready while named chats
attach their broker on demand. Production credentials and the `Codex Native2` connector are never
reused implicitly.
