# ChatGPT Web model receipts

The Web adapter emits a provider-private `chatgpt_model_receipt` diagnostic marker when an owned
conversation response contains one unambiguous network `resolved_model_slug`. The current launcher
records that structured marker through its existing daemon stdout/runtime log path; it is not a new
direct Activity IPC event. This is diagnostic evidence for the model that answered; it does not
change the public Responses `model` field, which continues to report the requested Web route.

The receipt keeps the request-side values separate:

- `requestedModel` is the native Responses route.
- `backendContextModel` is the adapter's internal context model, when it differs (for example,
  `gpt-5.6-sol` while a Pro Web route is requested).
- `browserRequestModel`, `defaultModelSlug`, `requestedModelSlug`, and `modelSlug` are retained as
  separate routing observations.
- `servedModel` is emitted only from `resolved_model_slug` in an owned network response.

DOM attributes, HTTP status, assistant/user prose, attachment metadata, and a missing or conflicting
`resolved_model_slug` never substitute for a served model. Chromium network bytes are streamed
through strict allowlists and bounded event/node/byte limits; response bodies are never
materialized by the observer. A completed browser answer may be followed by a bounded 750 ms
telemetry-only terminal drain so `Network.loadingFinished` can settle; this drain is separate from
inference and never retries or cancels the request. Electron targets whose CDP stream command
rejects use a reversible, page-local `fetch` clone/tee as the bounded fallback; the original fetch
and response body remain untouched. Only the current activated
`POST /backend-api/f/conversation` is eligible. Receipts are one-per-physical-Send, retain retry
attempt and provenance, and hash conversation/message identifiers before logging.
When both CDP and page-local observations terminate for one owned POST, their resolved
served/message/conversation evidence must agree; otherwise no receipt is emitted.
The page fallback announces a per-invocation nonce before reading the response and requires a
matching activated main-frame request, so a response initiated before activation cannot attach to
a later Send.

Diagnostics retain bounded, privacy-filtered metadata envelope fragments for real record/replay:
known `message`/`mapping`/`data`/`v` nesting, exact known metadata delta paths, enum states, safe
assistant/server model fields, and consistently hashed IDs. Prompts, answers, content/parts,
attachments, tool arguments, credentials, URLs, and unknown key names are never recorded.
`replayComplete` is false when frames or required metadata are dropped, redacted, or truncated;
`replayChatGptMetadataTrace()` refuses such recordings instead of reconstructing missing frames.
This does not change production parser authority or infer a served model from structural traces.

Complete sanitized diagnostics are stored under the private config directory's
`diagnostics/model-receipts/` with unique filenames, mode `0600`, and a 1 MiB file ceiling.
At 256 existing directory entries, the writer refuses new recordings with `bounded`
without deleting retained evidence; receipt identity and inference are unaffected.
The synchronous capacity check serializes one process, not an atomic multi-process
disk quota. Separate concurrent writers can overshoot the entry threshold. The
launcher log receives a short filename/SHA-256/byte-count reference, avoiding its 16 KiB string
limit. IO/size/privacy failures remain telemetry-only and fail closed. Recording is currently
unavailable on Windows because POSIX mode bits cannot establish Windows ACL privacy.
After a full-frame navigation, the worker awaits page-capture reinstall before Send activation;
diagnostics expose only bounded page lifecycle counters and an enum rejection reason.
They also expose bounded parser status/event/decoded-byte counts per capture source, never raw
response bodies or unknown response key names.

Each activated Send also emits one bounded diagnostic outcome through the same helper transport,
including unavailable-CDP, missing-metadata, conflict, bounded, and resolved outcomes. These
diagnostics contain bounded counters, enums, safe metadata, and private recording references;
they never substitute a served model.

The production observer uses the exact `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/f/conversation` URL. The
offline CDP integration test supplies a loopback URL only through an explicit constructor seam for
its self-owned fixture; it does not broaden the production predicate.

This parser was implemented clean-room for this project. Its field-selection and stream-observation
design was informed by the public [Lex-au/chatgpt-receipts](https://github.com/Lex-au/chatgpt-receipts)
extension, released under the MIT license; no extension source or UI/storage code is included here.
